### CSS
For validating my style sheet I used a validator from [W3C Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).
The validation returned no errors, only a few warnings that can be ignored. Please see the results of the validation below.

**Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO validations were carried out using the Lighthouse developer tool**

The table below provides the reference ranges and explanations for Lighthouse scores.

| Category        | Score Range | Color Indicator | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance** | 90â€“100      | ðŸŸ¢ Green         | Fast site loading and good runtime performance.                             |
|                 | 50â€“89       | ðŸŸ¡ Orange        | Moderate performance; room for improvement.                                 |
|                 | 0â€“49        | ðŸ”´ Red           | Poor performance; likely slow loading and resource-heavy.                   |
| **Accessibility** | 90â€“100    | ðŸŸ¢ Green         | Most users, including those with disabilities, can navigate the content.    |
|                 | 50â€“89       | ðŸŸ¡ Orange        | Some accessibility issues that may block certain users.                     |
|                 | 0â€“49        | ðŸ”´ Red           | Major accessibility barriers for users with disabilities.                   |
| **Best Practices** | 90â€“100   | ðŸŸ¢ Green         | Secure, modern web practices are followed.                                  |
|                 | 50â€“89       | ðŸŸ¡ Orange        | Some outdated or risky practices found.                                     |
|                 | 0â€“49        | ðŸ”´ Red           | Several critical issues affecting reliability or security.                  |
| **SEO**         | 90â€“100      | ðŸŸ¢ Green         | Good visibility to search engines and adherence to SEO basics.              |
|                 | 50â€“89       | ðŸŸ¡ Orange        | SEO could be improved for better search engine indexing.                    |
|                 | 0â€“49        | ðŸ”´ Red           | Poor SEO setup, affecting discoverability.                                  |


### Performance
Performance validation received the lowest score among all Lighthouse categories, averaging 74%. 
While the target is ideally 90% or higher, the lower performance score is mainly due to large image files that delay page loading. 
I explore this further in the [Limitations](README.md#image-sizing) section, as it represents a key opportunity for improvement in future projects.

### Accessibility
Accessibility validation resulted in a score of 100%.

### Best Practices
Best Practices validation resulted in a score of 100%.

### SEO
SEO validation resulted in a score of 100%.

Please see the results of the validation below.
