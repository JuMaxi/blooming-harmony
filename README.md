### Why this subject?

For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve felt a strong connection to nature and over time, that connection has grown into a personal mission to garden in a way that nurtures both the earth and all the life it supports.

Last year, I had the opportunity to volunteer at a **community sustainable garden**, where I worked alongside others who shared the same values. That experience truly opened my eyes to the power of growing food and flowers in harmony with nature. I learned how small actions‚Äîlike choosing organic seeds, composting kitchen waste, or planting for pollinators‚Äîcan make a meaningful difference.

Now, as I build my own garden, I continue to learn every day. I'm discovering natural, **safe chemical-free for plant diseases**, finding **gentle ways to coexist with local wildlife** like foxes, and deepening my understanding of **composting** as a way to give back to the soil. It‚Äôs a journey of patience, observation, and care.

Through this website, I hope to share what I'm learning and encourage others to join the movement toward more **sustainable, wildlife-friendly gardening**. I truly believe that the way we garden today can help build a better, greener future for our communities, our climate, and the generations to come.
