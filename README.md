### Why this subject?

For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve felt a strong connection to nature and over time, that connection has grown into a personal mission to garden in a way that nurtures both the earth and all the life it supports.

Last year, I had the opportunity to volunteer at a **community sustainable garden**, where I worked alongside others who shared the same values. That experience truly opened my eyes to the power of growing food and flowers in harmony with nature. I learned how small actions‚Äîlike choosing organic seeds, composting kitchen waste, or planting for pollinators‚Äîcan make a meaningful difference.

Now, as I build my own garden, I continue to learn every day. I'm discovering natural, **safe chemical-free for plant diseases**, finding **gentle ways to coexist with local wildlife** like foxes, and deepening my understanding of **composting** as a way to give back to the soil. It‚Äôs a journey of patience, observation, and care.

Through this website, I hope to share what I'm learning and encourage others to join the movement toward more **sustainable, wildlife-friendly gardening**. I truly believe that the way we garden today can help build a better, greener future for our communities, our climate, and the generations to come.

- **White** is used for **clarity and readability**, creating clean spaces between content and keeping the overall experience light, breathable, and uncluttered.
- **Colorful images** of flowers, vegetables, wildlife, and seasonal landscapes bring life and joy to the site. These images reflect the diversity and beauty of nature and remind users of the **rewarding outcomes of sustainable gardening**.

### Imagery & Themes

- The use of **real, vibrant images** featuring seasonal plants, pollinators, fruits, and wildlife showcases the richness of a living garden.
- Wildlife like **foxes, bees, birds, and squirrels** are featured to foster empathy and encourage readers to see their gardens as shared habitats‚Äînot just personal spaces.
- Images are used not only decoratively but also to **educate and inspire**, making the content more relatable and engaging for all skill levels.

### Emotional Message

The combination of these visual choices aims to **evoke a sense of peace, hope, and connection**. This isn‚Äôt just a gardening website‚Äîit's a gentle invitation to:
- **Reimagine gardening as an act of kindness** toward the planet.
- **Feel empowered** to make sustainable changes, even in small spaces.
- **See beauty and value in every part of the natural cycle**, from compost to bloom.

The design helps communicate that **sustainability isn‚Äôt about restriction it‚Äôs about reconnection**.

### Technologies
This project was developed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

#### HTML and CSS
I aimed to use semantic HTML tags wherever I identified it was appropriate, to ensure better structure and accessibility in my code.
I also added comments throughout to remind myself later of the reasons behind certain choices, whether it was using specific classes, 
applying particular styles, or making layout decisions.
I took the same approach with my CSS, creating custom class names that clearly reflected their purpose. 
I added comments, organised the code into sections, and structured it by hierarchy to keep everything readable and easy to maintain.
When I wasn‚Äôt sure how to use certain CSS or HTML elements, I often referred to the W3Schools documentation for guidance.

#### Bootstrap use
I made sure to carefully read the documentation whenever I wasn‚Äôt certain about how a Bootstrap feature worked or how it was affecting my code.

Before starting the project, I spent a good amount of time learning about Bootstrap‚Äôs breakpoints, which proved essential for building 
a responsive layout across different screen sizes.

My overall conclusion is that Bootstrap is a powerful tool for front-end development. But, it‚Äôs important to work closely with 
the documentation. There are so many features, and it‚Äôs impossible to learn everything all at once.

I also found that relying solely on Bootstrap classes can limit design flexibility. While they help make a site functional quickly,
adding my own custom CSS allowed me to achieve a more personalised and satisfying result when Bootstrap alone didn‚Äôt meet my design goals.

### AI use
I used AI in this project as a tool to optimise repetitive tasks, just as we learned in our lessons. 
For most of the main content sections, I created a general structure using <section> and nested divs with Bootstrap classes like container, row, and col.
Then, I wrote specific prompts and asked AI to generate the content I needed. Once I received the generated content, I would adjust it to fit my needs, 
for example, changing Bootstrap breakpoints for different screen sizes or applying custom styles to better suit my theme and design.
Whenever I encountered a Bootstrap class I didn‚Äôt understand, I asked the AI to explain its purpose. 
Often, I realised that some classes weren‚Äôt necessary for what I was building, so I removed or replaced them accordingly.
Not everything the AI generated worked exactly as expected, so I often did additional research to solve problems and achieve the results I was aiming for.
Although I used AI to help create the general content of my project, I made sure to read through everything carefully and modified anything I didn‚Äôt agree with or found unsuitable.
My overall conclusion is that AI is a powerful tool, especially for generating ideas and speeding up repetitive tasks, but without a clear understanding of the code it produces, you won‚Äôt be able to troubleshoot or write functional code on your own.
